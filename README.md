# Angular 1 Testing Style Guide

This guide was developed by @webWhizJim and is maintained by ng-nj, the Angular Group of New Jersey.

This is a standardized approach for setting up unit and e2e tests for common situations when developing new featuers in AngularJS.
It is intended to use the same style conventions as the [John Papa Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).

This guide is oppinionated in the sense that it assumes you are using our workflow which includes:

- Gulp
- Karma 
- Jasmine
- Proctractor
- ES5 JavaScript
- AngularJS 1.3, 1.4, or 1,5

We reccommend scaffolding from the yeoman generator [Gulp-Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-angular).
