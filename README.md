## Part 1: Intro to The Testing Triforce
---
<div name="history"></div>
### History of The Testing Triforce
The Testing Triforce phrase was coined by Jim Lynch. While working as an angularJS developer he was doing standard unit testing along with some Protractor tests. Jim then read a book on BDD (Behavior Driven Development) and fell in love with the gherkin syntax and the way is was connected to step definitions. It was unclear how exactly to fit this into an Angular, SPA, or general JavaScript project in a way that gelled nicely with the other types of automated tests. After intensely studying these types of testing and using the, on various real-world projects he finally [built of time] found a way of developing software that works well and incorporated the three types of automated tests. This document attempts to formalize this philosphy that is now known as The Testing Triforce.

<div name="Purpose of The Testing Triforce"></div>
### Purpose of The Testing Triforce

The testing triforce is meant to prescribe a way for writing three types of automated tests: acceptance tests, e2e tests, and unit tests, but even more than that it builds on the test-first theories of TDD. Thus, the testing triforce becomes a tao, or way of developing software where the result is truly transparent, agile, and well-done. This guide provides a set of instructions for developing with The Triforce Testing mindset, but it is up to you to find the tao on your own.

<div name="It's Not Specific Angular"></div>
### It's Not Specific Angular
It should be noted that the Testing Triforce is not something that is dependant on the Angular library. It can be applied to really any project made from html, css, and javascript which can be tested with Protractor and JavaScript unit testing framework like Jasmine or Chai-Mocha. It can even be applied to other front-end platforms like .NET, Ios, Android, Java, Ruby, C++, etc. although you will need different tooling for that platform than what is discussed here. 

<div name="This is a Guide"></div>
### This is a Guide For Developing Great Software
This document is meant to be a guide for implementing Triforce testing into your own project. Rather than be taken as gospel, the ideas expressed here are meant to convince you of the benefits of implementing these three types of automated testing. The prescribes methodoligies here have been tried a tested, but you are free to change things in your own case if you find it necessary to do so. Note that this is not a guide for writing or running any of the three test types (although you may find the sample config files and shell commands useful). Rather, this is a more meta guide on building great software by leveraging automated testing.

<div name="The Triforce Diagram"></div>
### The Triforce Diagram

![testing triforce](./images/testing-triforce.png "Testing Triforce")

*credit: the triforce image is a copyrighted symbol of Nintendo Corporation.*

The triforce is a symbol popularized by the video games franchise "The Legend of Zelda".

Here we use it to represent the three types of automated tests: 

- Acceptance Tests
- E2e Tests
- Unit Tests

<div name="Acceptance Tests"></div>
### Acceptance Tests
<img src="./images/cucumber.png" height="47"><img src="./images/protractor.png" height="50"> <img src="./images/mocha-chai.png" height="50">

Acceptance tests, at the very top of the triforce, should be the starting point at the beginning of any automated testing effort. Because it necessarily forces you to think about the application in high level terms about what it is actually doing, it is a perfect way to **figure out what you want to build** while at the same time *effectively communicating those ideas to the developers, business analysts, and other stakeholders*. 

The gherkin feature files are normally referred to as high level acceptance tests. Using the Given-When-Then-And-But syntax, these high level acceptance tests are then mapped to low-level acceptance tests, written in your projects main programming language (in this case JavaScript). 

Acceptance tests don't end with the feature files in Gherkin syntax. Acceptance tests refer to both the feature files and the step definition files. These should be basically selenium web-tests. Some people may be inclined to treat the low level step definition methods as if they were unit tests. **Don't fall into this trap.** 


These are tests that come from the theory of behavior-driven development. They consist of two types of filesâ€“ feature files and step definition files. At ng-nj, we like to use Cucumber.js for this, and we recommend running it through Protractor by selecting the cucumber framework in your protractor.conf.js file. Although these tests are "web tests" and focus on testing the ui in a selenium-like fashion, these tests should use mock data and should NOT be hitting external endpoints. Since these are high level feature specifications tied to low-level step defintions, these tests will cover all of the acceptance criteria for the project.  

<div name="E2e Tests"></div>
### E2e Tests
<img src="./images/karma.png" height="50"><img src="./images/protractor.png" height="50"> <img src="./images/mocha-chai.png" height="50">

These are tests that do hit external endpoints. Normally, we set these up in a separate protractor.conf.js file. Althoguh we use protractor for these tests, they are not as concerned with simulating an actual user interacting with the application. These tests are solely with interacting with external resources to ensure that they work as expected. These tests could do such things like check to see if files exist in a remote location, check that any random transaction works for your current database instance, check that saving and retrieving data from the file system works, etc. this is also the place where you might put exploratory tests (tests that try to expose bugs) or other types of stress tests.

<div name="Unit Tests"></div>
### Unit Tests
<img src="./images/karma.png" height="47"><img src="./images/jasmine.png" height="50"> <img src="./images/mocha-chai.png" height="50">

Ahh, the unit tests. Incorporating heavy Protractor usage for E2e and acceptance tests should not steal any thunder at all from the classic unit tests. Indeed, doing all that preparatory Protractor work and writing out the features in gherkin, makes it much easier to start unit testing because you have a clear direction of where you want to be. Unit tests are concerned with checking individual functions. These normally return a coverage report, and as always we aim for 100% coverage by unit tests.

<div name="The Triforce in Practice"></div>
## Part 3: The Triforce in Practice
This section provides some advice for using the Triforce in Practice.

<div name="Where Do I Put My Files"></div>
### Where Do I Put My Files? 
Most experienced SPA developers agree that at a high level a feature-based directory structure scales best and that parallel directory structures should be avoided. Tests that can be directly attributedto certain classes or features should be near them. We recommend putting a *feature* directory in the root directory of that particular feature. Then put the .feature file and step definitions (optionally in a step_definitions subfolder) inside of the new directory. For units tests I like to keep the .spec.js test file directly next to the correponsing .js file. Since our acceptance tests are the selenium / Protractor tests heavily tied to the features, the E2e tests can be more general. For example, an e2e test could just check that a database endpoint returns *something.* This has nothing to do with any particular feature, and for this reason it's customary to have an e2e folder on the same level as the src folder which stores all of the e2e tests. In JavaScript a good build script can sort out the feature and step definition files so it's fine to put your acceptance tests and unit tests right in the src folder with the relevant files for that particular feature. As a final note on this topic I'll mention that if you do decide to have *parallel directory trees* and your apps grows large enough you (or your developers) are going to be scrolling like crazy, losing track of files, and possibly considering giving up on testing. Make good choices about your directory structure.                                 

<div name="The Gherkin Comes First"></div>
### Gherkin Comes First
Is a piece of software really anything more than the features it provides? What better way to begin describing a project than by describing gherkin features and scenarios? And if we are discussing them, we might as well write them into .feature files because then they can be stored in version control, referred back to later, and even executed by command shell.  

We recommend running your gherkin JavaScript files through Protractor by setting the framework to "".
Here is an example of a protractor.conf file:

`

`

Add this file to your project and then install the necessary modules

``
``

Now you should be able to run gherkin tests like this:
` `

<div name="Implement Step Definitions with Protractor"></div>
### Implement Step Definitions with Protractor Selenium Tests
If you are using the protractor config file above then you might notice that for the step definition files it's only looking for .steps.js files. This means we can put them anywhere in our project, and we don't need any *step_definitions* folders (but if you think it makes things more readable go ahead and use them). The scenarios will almost always be from a user's point of view, and so it naturally follows to automate the tests from the user's point of view. This is why we write low level step definitions with protractor api. Your scenarios should just describe things that should happen, and in the protractor tests you can *expect* those things to happen after clicking (or interacting with in another way) some element on the page. Also, notice that these tests are still using the underlying functions of the application and so the protractor tests are indirectly testing individual functions of the application. However, because this protractor tests check the application in a *black box* fashion, when errors fail it's tough to find the root cause of issues from these tests alone. 


<div name="Implement E2e Tests in a Separate Protractor Conf.js file"></div>
### Implement E2e Tests in a Separate Protractor Conf.js file.
This section is purposely put before "write the production code" because it should come first. Unless you have a really hazy idea of what you're building (red flag), you should at least know what external resources you are connecing to. Even if the backend has not been finished yet, you can still set up the e2e test firing away at it from day one, and simply let it fail. Comment it out if it bothers you, and then as soon as that endpoint is ready add that e2e test back in. Some developers get flustered and afraid when they think about writing e2e tests, but actually these are the easiest of all.

Here is a sample protractor file for running e2e tests:
`


`

You can run this with this command:
`     `


<div name="Write Unit Tests and Code TDD Style"></div>
### Write Unit Tests and Code TDD Style 
Write the actually code in the usual TDD style with unit tests is code while using the protractor tests and gherkin feature files as a guide for what the code should do. For modern JavaScript development, karma seems to have gained a stronghold as the most popular unit test runner. Many scaffolded pojects have support for unit testing out of the box, but they are really just providing you with a karma.conf.js file. You could make this file yourself or change your current one as you like. 

Here is an example of a karma.conf.js file:
`



`

Don't forget to install karma:
`     `

And then run it like this:
`      `

You can put .spec.js files anywhere in the src/ folder and they will automatically be picked up when you run karma. 

<div name="Deployment"></div>
### Notes on Deployment
We recommend a CI pipeline that will automatically run 1) your acceptance tests protrator file, 2) your e2e tests protractor file, and 3) your karma unit tests file. If you don't have a CI server set up, you could always run these three tests manually. The key is that you trust these tests so that they will continue to be run and maintained as the development unfolds. 

<div name="Testing On Multiple Browsers"></div>
### Testing On Multiple Browsers
Sauce Labs is basically the ones running the show in this area, and connecting to Sauce is even built into the api of Protractor!


<div name="Everyone Reads, Devs Change"></div>
### Everyone Reads the Gherkin, Dev's Change the Gherkin
Because the feature files are somewhat scattered around the project's directory structure it can be a little overwhelming for a non-developer to pull the project repo just to read the feature files. The key is to keep the feature files easily readable and accessible by all. Therefore, all non-programmers should be referring to the cucumber reports that are automatically generated. These will show all of the features and scenarios in a nice, collapsable format. If they wish to chhange something it should be discussing with the programmers who then make a change to the feature file in question and push that up to the git repository which then updates the hosted cucumber reports.

<div name="No Manual Testers"></div>
### No Manual Testers
Too often large development companies have qa teams that are just squads of manual testers. Manual testing should be though of as the enemy and avoided. Anything worth testing manually can and should be automated with Protractor. If you currently have manual testers, teach them the ways of Protractor.

<div name="Additional Benefits of Triforce Development"></div>
## Part 4: Additional Benefits of Triforce Development

<div name="Better Team Communication and Ubiquitous Language"></div>
### Better Team Communication and Ubiquitous Language
It is truly amazing how much gherkin feature files can bring a team together. 

<div name="The Requirements and Code Are Always In Sync"></div>
### The Requirements and Code Are Always In Sync
One of the really nice things about using gherkin feature files instead of having some external planning software is that with gherkin your plans are always in sync with your tests, and your test are always in sync with your code. Thus, the plans stay in sync with the the code. When you plans are not directly embedded in the code it becomes easy to let the plans become out of date and brush them aside. With gherkin, these plans are executed via the command line and drive the decision for acceptance of the entire codebase. This gives the planning an importance unlike any other methodology, and they necessarily must be maintained, taken seriously, and should be considered as important as any other code for the project. 

<div name="No Manual Testing"></div>
### No Manual Testing
Manual testing can be a huge drain on time and resources. Of course you may not remove manual testing *entirely*, but not having a whole QA team of manual testers and shortening the QA time can be hugely beneficial to an organization in terms of saving potentislly burned cash and being more nimble with changes, bug fixes, and releases.
